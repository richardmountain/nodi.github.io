So since I’ve decided to start developing games, I figured it might be a good idea to post at least one game on my new site for people to see and possibly play.

This game is called Meteors, it is a clone as I’m sure a lot of you will tell of the classic Asteroids which was released in 1979.  I wanted to start with something easy to get the ball rolling, it’s not exactly the same as the original but it’s close enough.
