Hello, my name is Richard and by trade I’m a web developer.
Like most boys/men that are into video games I too wanted to make them but I’ve never had the real drive to do it.  But now that I’ve turn 30 and have a little boy of my own I have found myself wanting to have ago in the evenings while he sleeps.

At the time of writing this I have built 1 game which will be found on this site somewhere called Asteroids.  This is basically a clone of the original Asteroids game released in 1979.  The game was initially built as an indie game to use for a small competition but that never amounted to anything so the source code has been sat in my private github repo for the best part of 2 years.  Since I was setting up this site I decided to dig out the old code and compile it into HTML5 so that I could show it off on my site.

So I’m hoping to use my blog as a way of storing my newly gained experiences, knowledge and goals, maybe even some previews of games I’m working on.

My inspirations for this site and just having ago are both [HeartBeast](http://www.heartbeast.co/) and [True Valhalla](https://www.truevalhalla.com/) who both develop games for a living.  Who knows maybe one day I’ll be someones inspiration.
